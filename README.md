# WebChatApp
This project represents my initial attempt at developing a chat application, drawing significant inspiration from 'Messenger.'

During the development process, I initially chose to implement a RESTful API architecture. However, I later realized that this approach may not be optimal for real-time communication features typically required in chat applications. In retrospect, leveraging Web Sockets would have been a more suitable solution. Nonetheless, this experience has provided valuable insights for my future projects.
